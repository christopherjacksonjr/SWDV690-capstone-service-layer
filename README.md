## :bento: Overview

Purpose: Vacation Hub. A blog for users to upload photos of their vacations. Users will be able to add details of their experience, ratings, and pricing information for others to see. Vacation Hub is designed to help its users plan a cost efficient vacation all in one place. This will serve as a 'one stop shop' for planning a vacation all the way from picking a location, looking at prices, to posting photos to share with your friends and family.

Description: The service layer of the application is where the business logic of the application will reside. This will be the brains behind the application that will do the heavy lifting on all the CRUD operations to add, update, and delete users and posts. Along with this there will be a database to store all of this information so that it can be retrieved when needed. The service layer will be connected to the database for theses operations to happen seemlessly to the user. This ties back into this application being an easy experience for the user to plan their dream vacations.
